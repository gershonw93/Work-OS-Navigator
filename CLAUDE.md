# SyteNav - working agreement

## Ship workflow (IMPORTANT)
When work is done: **build → commit → push → merge to `main` → fast-forward the
production branch.** Do NOT ask the user to merge or deploy.
- Work on a `claude/*` branch, then open/merge a PR into `main` via the GitHub MCP tools.
- **Vercel's production branch is `claude/admiring-bohr-DyFVR`, NOT `main`.** Builds
  off `main` are previews only. After merging, fast-forward it or nothing ships:
  `git push origin origin/main:refs/heads/claude/admiring-bohr-DyFVR`
  (Changing this is one setting: Vercel → project → Git → Production Branch.)
- Migrations are applied directly via the Supabase MCP (`apply_migration`) as
  part of shipping - the user does NOT paste SQL by hand. Verify the schema
  landed, then say what ran. Don't nag about deploy.

## Migrations
- Numbered files in `supabase/migrations/`. Apply them with the Supabase MCP
  (`apply_migration`, project `rxdqmetqvfninvaqymyl` - "Work OS Navigator").
- Combined, idempotent SQL is still kept current at
  `supabase/migrations/_combined_008-068.sql` (bump the suffix as you add
  migrations) as the fallback for a fresh environment.
- IMPORTANT: verify every column you `.select()` actually exists - Supabase
  returns `data: null` for an unknown column, so a typo reads as "not found"
  rather than an error. `projects` has `client`, NOT `client_name`.

## What's new (KEEP CURRENT)
- User-facing release notes live in `lib/whats-new.ts`, shown at `/whats-new`.
- IMPORTANT: when you ship something a user would NOTICE, add an entry in the
  SAME change. Internal refactors and build fixes do not belong there.
- Newest first; `date` drives the unread badge in the sidebar, so keep it real.

## Help Center (KEEP CURRENT)
- User-facing support articles live in `lib/help/articles.ts`, shown at `/help`.
- IMPORTANT: whenever you add or change a feature/flow, update the matching
  article (or add a new one) in the SAME change so Help never drifts from the app.
- Search is client-side; keep each article's `keywords` list rich so it's findable.

## Back burner (KEEP CURRENT)
- Parked / future ideas live in `BACKLOG.md` at the repo root.
- When we defer an idea, add it there; when we ship one, move it to "Recently shipped" with the PR #.

## Stack notes
- Next.js 14 App Router, Supabase (Postgres + Storage), Tailwind.
- Theme: SyteNav "Field" - semantic CSS-var tokens (surface/panel/ink/accent…),
  light + dark. Use token classes (bg-panel, text-ink, text-muted-fg, border-line,
  bg-accent/text-accent-fg, success/warn/danger/info), NOT raw slate/white/orange.
- Storage buckets: `daily-log-photos`, `submittals`.
- Always run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx next build` before merging.
