# SyteNav - working agreement

## Ship workflow (IMPORTANT)
When work is done: **build → commit → push → merge to `main` → fast-forward the
production branch.** Do NOT ask the user to merge or deploy.
- Work on a `claude/*` branch, then open/merge a PR into `main` via the GitHub MCP tools.
- **Vercel's production branch is `claude/admiring-bohr-DyFVR`, NOT `main`.** Builds
  off `main` are previews only. After merging, fast-forward it or nothing ships:
  `git push origin origin/main:refs/heads/claude/admiring-bohr-DyFVR`
  (Changing this is one setting: Vercel → project → Git → Production Branch.)
- Migrations are applied directly via the Supabase MCP (`apply_migration`) as
  part of shipping - the user does NOT paste SQL by hand. Verify the schema
  landed, then say what ran. Don't nag about deploy.

## Migrations
- Numbered files in `supabase/migrations/`. Apply them with the Supabase MCP
  (`apply_migration`, project `rxdqmetqvfninvaqymyl` - "Work OS Navigator").
- Combined, idempotent SQL is still kept current at
  `supabase/migrations/_combined_008-086.sql` (bump the suffix as you add
  migrations) as the fallback for a fresh environment.
- IMPORTANT: verify every column you `.select()` actually exists - Supabase
  returns `data: null` for an unknown column, so a typo reads as "not found"
  rather than an error. `projects` has `client`, NOT `client_name`, and has no
  `client_email` at all (the address is on `customers`).
- The same class of silent failure on the way BACK: read the wrong key off a
  response and you get `undefined`, which a truthiness guard swallows. A Send
  box sat permanently blank because a component read `d.email` from a route
  that answers `{ clientEmail }`. If two places read one endpoint, give them
  one reader (`lib/use-client-email.ts`) rather than two chances to be wrong.

## What's new (KEEP CURRENT)
- User-facing release notes live in `lib/whats-new.ts`, shown at `/whats-new`.
- IMPORTANT: when you ship something a user would NOTICE, add an entry in the
  SAME change. Internal refactors and build fixes do not belong there.
- Newest first; `date` drives the unread badge in the sidebar, so keep it real.

## Help Center (KEEP CURRENT)
- User-facing support articles live in `lib/help/articles.ts`, shown at `/help`.
- IMPORTANT: whenever you add or change a feature/flow, update the matching
  article (or add a new one) in the SAME change so Help never drifts from the app.
- Search is client-side; keep each article's `keywords` list rich so it's findable.

## QuickBooks (KEEP CURRENT)
- One-way push, SyteNav -> QuickBooks Online. All of it lives in
  `lib/quickbooks-push.ts`; the manual Settings sync and the automatic push
  call the SAME functions so they cannot drift.
- **The connection is PER COMPANY.** A company only ever pushes to its own
  QuickBooks file, and the sync only sees the company you are signed into.
  Counting "unsynced" across companies is how you end up telling somebody
  their payment failed to sync when it was never in that company's scope.
- ACCRUAL, and the halves must move together: a SENT client invoice becomes a
  QBO Invoice (A/R); a payment becomes a Payment applied against it; a deposit
  with no invoice to settle becomes a Sales Receipt. **A sale must never be
  counted twice** - a Sales Receipt already means sold AND paid, so if an
  invoice exists, the money settling it can never be another receipt.
- Order matters when settling: record the PAYMENT first, then flip the invoice
  to paid. The applied-payment lookup finds the oldest invoice still `sent`.
- Every push: never throws, capped at 8s, "not connected" is a normal state,
  and misses land in `quickbooks_sync_log` for the backlog sync to pick up.
- Pushes take an atomic claim (`qbo_claimed_at`) via a conditional UPDATE. A
  check-then-act guard is NOT enough: a double-pressed button created two QBO
  invoices for one record, and the spare became an orphan receivable.

## Product brief for non-developers (KEEP CURRENT)
- A prospect/customer-facing brief is published as an Artifact - what SyteNav
  does, how billing works, the QuickBooks answers, and an honest "what it does
  not do yet". It is what gets pasted into a chat to answer customer questions.
- URL: see `docs/product-brief-url.txt`.
- IMPORTANT: republish it in the SAME change as What's New and the Help
  article whenever something a user would notice ships - especially anything
  that changes an answer in the "what it does not do yet" list.

## Back burner (KEEP CURRENT)
- Parked / future ideas live in `BACKLOG.md` at the repo root.
- When we defer an idea, add it there; when we ship one, move it to "Recently shipped" with the PR #.

## Stack notes
- Next.js 14 App Router, Supabase (Postgres + Storage), Tailwind.
- Theme: SyteNav "Field" - semantic CSS-var tokens (surface/panel/ink/accent…),
  light + dark. Use token classes (bg-panel, text-ink, text-muted-fg, border-line,
  bg-accent/text-accent-fg, success/warn/danger/info), NOT raw slate/white/orange.
- Storage buckets: `daily-log-photos`, `submittals`.
- Always run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx next build` before merging.
